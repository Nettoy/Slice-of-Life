# Slice-of-Life
UMKC | CS 101 | Python - Slice of Life 

Hello! This is a Python program for my CS 101 class at UMKC.
The program runs a slice game that gives you random slices based on a difficulty of your choosing.
The game tracks your correct answers and gives you a score at the end of the game.
